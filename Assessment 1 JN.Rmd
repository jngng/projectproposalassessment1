### **Introduction** 

As technology rapidly develops around the world, the Internet is is an indespensible factor in the majority of people's daily lives as it has created a multitude of opportunities and revolutionised the way we learn, work and communicate. Although most of us use the Internet regularly, it is important to recognise that only 60% of the world's population is present online in 2020. 

This report explores the collected data related to the global population's exposure to the Internet. The collected data are analysed to gain valuable insights into factors that may contribute to the technological discrepancies; these may be due to socioeconomic factors, geographical regions or political agendas.     

Research Questions:     
- What are the factors that contribute and have effects on the region's/country's Internet usage?      
- Did COVID-19 affect the world's Internet usage and digital connectivity?

### **Data Set Introduction** 

The following report contains 3 different data sets collected from [Our World in Data - Internet](https://ourworldindata.org/internet) (Our World in Data, n.d.). The first data set explores the Number of Internet Users around the world, the second data set provides information on the proportion of individuals using the Internet and the last set focuses on the number of landline Internet subscriptions.      

**Data Set 1** contains variables: 'Entity', 'Code', 'Year' and 'Number of Internet Users'

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE}

# read in data of Number of Internet Users 

# another commend to test whether i can create a conflict 

numberOfInternetUsers = read.csv('number-of-internet-users.csv')

# get variables from data set 

dataSet1Variables = names(numberOfInternetUsers)

numberOfInternetUsersVariables = data.frame(Variables = dataSet1Variables)

<i>Figure 1</i> presents the number of people who have used the Internet in the past 3 months. The variables have been sub-divided into geographical locations to demonstrate a more thorough analysis on the increase of Internet users. 

- The variable 'World' presents as the highest number of Internet users as it calculates the total globally. The graph shows the region 'Asia' with the highest number of Internet users. This is consistent from the year 2002 as 'Asia' surpassed the region 'North America' in Internet users, with 212.70 million and 205.26 million users respectively. Before 2002, the region 'North America' had the leading number of Internet users. Furthermore, in 2003, the geographical region 'Europe' also surpassed 'North America' with 227.61 million and 218.60 million Internet users respectively. 

- In 2020, 'Asia' recorded an impressive 2.55 billion Internet users, accounting for 54% of the global total represented by the 'World' variable, which stood at 4.70 billion users. This highlights the significant presence of 'Asia' in the global Internet landscape. Moreover, since 2006, 'Asia' has experienced rapid growth in Internet users, surpassing the growth rates of other geographical regions.

- The region 'Oceania' shows the lowest growth in Internet users compared to other regions. This could be attributed to the smaller populations of Pacific islands within this region, which may limit the overall growth of Internet usage.

- It is worth noting a significant surge in Internet users from 2019 to 2020, particularly when considering the 'World' entity. This notable increase can be attributed to various factors, with the COVID-19 pandemic playing a significant role. The global outbreak prompted many countries to implement work from home measures and social distancing protocols, leading to a substantial rise in Internet usage.

e = ggplot(individualsUsingInternetEntities, aes(x = Year, y = Individuals.using.the.Internet....of.population., group = Entity, color = Entity)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + labs(x = "Year", y = "Percentage of the Population using the Internet") + theme_minimal()

e

```

The line chart illustrates the percentage of population engaging in Internet usage within the past 3 months. The 'World' entity serves as the reference point for the standard percentage of Internet usage. From the chart, we can observe that entities such as 'North America', 'Europe and Central Asia', 'Middle East and North Africa', 'Latin America and Caribbean', and 'East Asia and Pacific' surpass the 'World' standard in terms of Internet usage.

- A notable factor contributing to the high percentage in 'Europe and Central Asia' is the significant population density in this region, particularly due to countries like China. As previously mentioned, China stands out as the country with the highest number of Internet users globally. This prevalence of Internet usage in China contributes to the relatively high percentage observed in the 'Europe and Central Asia' entity.

- By examining the deviations from the 'World' standard across different regions, we gain insights into the varying levels of Internet adoption and usage worldwide.

i

```

The line chart presents the distribution of fixed broadband subscriptions across different sociodemographic categories, including High Income, Low and Middle Income, Low Income, Lower Middle Income, Middle Income, and Upper Middle Income.

- The chart reveals that the Middle Income demographic exhibits the highest number of fixed broadband subscriptions, followed by the Upper Middle Income category in the second position. This observation suggests that countries falling within these income brackets have a higher level of adoption and access to fixed broadband services.

- It is worth recognising that while the High Income demographic is traditionally associated with greater wealth, the population size may be smaller in comparison to the Middle Income and Upper Middle Income groups. Consequently, the overall number of fixed broadband subscriptions within the High Income category is relatively lower than those of the Middle Income and Upper Middle Income categories due to the smaller population size.

The bar chart presented in <i>Figure 11</i> presents the lowest 15 countries in terms of fixed broadband subscription. 

- These countries exhibit a major contrast when compared to the previous chart, primarily due to their limited number of subscriptions, which is below 20,000. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, including the overall economic prosperity and the countries' capacity to provide widespread access to fixed broadband services.

- A significant portion of the countries shown in this graph are located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the relatively large populations of countries like the Central African Republic, Congo, and South Sudan, their limited fixed broadband subscription numbers can be attributed to factors such as economic stability and political circumstances, which impact their ability to provide widespread access to broadband services.

- Additionally, the presence of small Pacific islands like Nauru, Tuvalu, Palau, and others also affects their subscription rates due to their limited population size and geographical constraints.
