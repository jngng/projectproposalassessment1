The chart presents the number of people who have used the Internet in the past 3 months. The variables have been sub-divided into geographical locations to demonstrate a more thorough analysis on the increase of Internet users. 

The variable 'World' presents as the highest number of Internet users as it calculates the total globally. The analysis shows the region 'Asia' with the highest number of Internet users. This is consistent from the year 2002 as 'Asia' surpassed the region 'North America' in Internet users, with 212.70 million and 205.26 million users respectively. Before 2002, the region 'North America' had the leading number of Internet users. Furthermore, in 2003, the geographical region 'Europe' also surpassed 'North America' with 227.61 million and 218.60 million Internet users respectively. 

In 2020, 'Asia' recorded an impressive 2.55 billion Internet users, accounting for 54% of the global total represented by the 'World' variable, which stood at 4.70 billion users. This highlights the significant presence of 'Asia' in the global Internet landscape. Moreover, since 2006, 'Asia' has experienced rapid growth in Internet users, surpassing the growth rates of other geographical regions.

Interestingly, the region 'Oceania' shows the lowest growth in Internet users compared to other regions. This could be attributed to the smaller populations of Pacific islands within this region, which may limit the overall growth of Internet usage.

Furthermore, it is worth noting a significant surge in Internet users from 2019 to 2020, particularly when considering the 'World' entity. This notable increase can be attributed to various factors, with the COVID-19 pandemic playing a significant role. The global outbreak prompted many countries to implement work-from-home measures and social distancing protocols, leading to a substantial rise in Internet usage.

As people worldwide were required to adapt to remote work setups, online learning platforms, and virtual communication tools, the reliance on the Internet grew exponentially. Moreover, the necessity for individuals to isolate themselves physically resulted in an increased reliance on online platforms for various activities, including entertainment, shopping, and social interactions.
